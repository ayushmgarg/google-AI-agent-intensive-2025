\# google-AI-agent-intensive-2025 | November 10-14, 2025  

All the projects made for the Google AI agents intensive 2025 course, on Kaggle.



\## 📚 Course Overview



This intensive course explores the shift from traditional LLM prompting to full-fledged autonomous agent systems that can plan, act, recall, evaluate, and coordinate. Built by Google's AI engineers and researchers in partnership with Kaggle.

\## 📅 Day 1: Introduction to Agents \& Agentic Architectures



\### Key Concepts



\- \*\*What are AI Agents?\*\* Systems that go beyond simple prompting by incorporating planning, action, memory, and evaluation capabilities

\- \*\*Agent Loop Workflow\*\* The core cycle of perceiving, reasoning, acting, and learning that differentiates agents from static model calls

\- \*\*Single-Agent Architecture\*\* Building autonomous systems that can execute multi-step tasks independently

\- \*\*Refinement Cycles\*\* How agents iterate and improve their outputs through feedback loops

\- \*\*From Prompt to Action\*\* Understanding the progression from basic LLM calls to sophisticated agentic behavior



\### Notebooks Completed



\- `day-1.ipynb` - Introduction to agent fundamentals \& Deep dive into loop workflows and refinement cycles



What kind of agent to choose?
